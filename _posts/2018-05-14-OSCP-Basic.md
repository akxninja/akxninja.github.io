<br>
<br>**Level 1.1** - The first Step should be to learn and understand Bash follow this Youtube [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag)
<br>But I hope if you are thinking of doing OSCP you must have knowledge of Bash, if not then you can look up the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag).
<br>
<br>**Level 1.2** – Now after learning Some bash commands you must be wondering and have doubt for what command we used and why? To understand all this, you can follow this site, just enter the command you want to know about and it will explain you the working nature of that command.

<br>
<br>**Level 1.3** - Then after Completing a Basic Bash training you should start doing some [Challenges](https://cmdchallenge.com).
<br>
<br>**Level 1.4** – Next step is to get familiar with one of the editing tool either it could be Nano or VI or Vim it's totally upon you.
If you want to learn Vim you can follow this site, to learn in a fun way [vim-adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
<br>
<br>**Level 1.5** – Now comes the very important part as we go forward and finish this basic preparation guide, we need to learn at least a single language, if you have knowledge of more than one then it is good, but if you don't know any language and have a time limitation, then I would suggest with regards to OSCP learning python is the best option.
<br>If you are new to pythons, then I would suggest to follow first get the basic Idea of python from following two site, and they have mobile applications also available which makes it handy to learn on the go. Python will help us understanding a lot of exploits and Bof fuzzing and exploit writing.
