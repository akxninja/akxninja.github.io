title: (OWASP) A9-Using Components with known Vulnerability
categories:
  - Web-Pentesting
---

<p>Some vulnerable components (e.g., framework libraries) can be identified and exploited with automated tools, expanding the threat agent pool beyond targeted attackers to include chaotic actors.
Attacker identifies a weak component through scanning or manual analysis. He customizes the exploit as needed and executes the attack. It gets more difficult if the used component is deep in the application.</p>
<br>Virtually every application has these issues because most development teams don’t focus on ensuring their components/libraries are up to date. In many cases, the developers don’t even know all the components they are using, never mind their versions. Component dependencies make things even worse.

  <font color="Black">Question 1</font> – Brief this Category:
</p>
<br>**Ans**:- 

*	A wealth of reusable software components available, including open source libraries.
*	Using these Components is a fast way to build feature – rich software.
*	With the free features, you also get free Security bugs.
*	Open Source libraries include 20-year-old code.
*	Open Source maintainers are volunteers.
*	Vulnerabilities in 3rd part components part of the other OWASP Top 10 categories.

  <font color="Black">Question 2</font> – Name few Vulnerabilities which comes under this section?
</p>
<br>**Ans**:- In 2014, We saw two Vulnerabilities that raised huge media awareness.

*	__Heartbleed__ – A Buffer Overflow Vulnerability in the widely – used encryption library open SSL.
*	__Shellshock__ – A shell command injection vulnerability in the ubiquitous Bash Unix Command line.
*	Both Vulnerabilities have sent companies scrambling to deploy Security patches.
